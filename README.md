# LeafDevpostGame
A game I made for the Leaf hackathon

It is majorly based of choice making and I made it in about a day. I joined the hackathon too late to get really in-depth into the story.
There is about 3 mins in each playthrough and 3 total endings. If you get all the endings CONGRATS!

It is riddled with easter eggs to my own life.

If you are wondering about why I did a game like this it is because I am a rom-com fan (everyone is) and I wanted to make a text choice-based game that reflected a fun story like this. With some unpredictable endings hopefully.
