# LeafDevpostGame
A game I made for the Leaf hackathon

To play run the following commands:
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
                                    
$ python3 RealLove.py

It is majorly based of choice making and I made it in about a day. I joined the hackathon too late to get really in-depth into the story.
There is about 3 mins in each playthrough and 3 total endings. If you get all the endings CONGRATS!

It is riddled with easter eggs to my own life.

If you are wondering about why I did a game like this it is because I am a rom-com fan (everyone is) and I wanted to make a text choice-based game that reflected a fun story like this. With some unpredictable endings hopefully.

You need the python library 'colorama' to play this game so I will include a requirements.txt for easy dowload of this library.
